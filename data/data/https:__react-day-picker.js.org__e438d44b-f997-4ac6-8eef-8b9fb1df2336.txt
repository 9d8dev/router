DayPicker is a [React](https://react.dev/) component to create date pickers, calendars, and date inputs for web applications.

DayPicker is written in TypeScript and compiled to CommonJS and ESM. It requires [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/) as a peer dependency.

```
import { DayPicker } from "react-day-picker";import "react-day-picker/dist/style.css";function MyDatePicker() {  const [selected, setSelected] = useState<Date>();  return <DayPicker mode="single" selected={selected} onSelect={setSelected} />;}
```

Title: useFormContext

URL Source: https://react-hook-form.com/docs/useformcontext

Markdown Content:
This custom hook allows you to access the form context. `useFormContext` is intended to be used in deeply nested structures, where it would become inconvenient to pass the context as a prop.

This hook will return all the useForm return methods and props.

import React from "react"

import { useForm, FormProvider, useFormContext } from "react-hook-form"

export default function App() {

const methods \= useForm()

const onSubmit \= (data) \=> console.log(data)

return (

<FormProvider {...methods}\>

<form onSubmit\={methods.handleSubmit(onSubmit)}\>

<NestedInput /\>

<input type\="submit" /\>

</form\>

</FormProvider\>

)

}

function NestedInput() {

const { register } \= useFormContext()

return <input {...register("test")} /\>

}
